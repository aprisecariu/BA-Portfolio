# Online Course Platform Project

## Backlog and Timeline

Please note that the **Initial_Backlog.png** and **Project_Initial_Timeline.png** are always **subject to change**. Hence the name "initial".

## Agile Methodology

In an agile environment, the features illustrated in our user stories are prone to shifts in priorities. This flexibility allows us to respond to changing needs and deliver the most value to our users. We embrace change, even late in the development process, and continuously improve based on feedback and learning.

## Insights on Potential Changes

### Complexity and Dependencies

1. **User Registration System**:
   - Complexity in implementing secure authentication mechanisms and handling user data.
   - Dependencies on third-party authentication services or libraries.

2. **Course Listing & Search**:
   - Complexity in designing efficient search algorithms and user-friendly interfaces.
   - Dependencies on the availability and structure of course data.

3. **Payment Processing**:
   - High complexity due to the need for secure transaction handling and compliance with payment regulations.
   - Dependencies on integration with payment gateways and third-party services.

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Complexity in tracking user interactions and providing real-time updates.
   - Dependencies on reliable data storage and processing systems.

5. **Content Management System**:
   - Complexity in building robust tools for content creation and management.
   - Dependencies on the scalability and performance of the backend infrastructure.

6. **User Interface (UI) Design**:
   - Complexity in ensuring a consistent and responsive design across different devices.
   - Dependencies on user feedback and usability testing results.

Our agile approach allows us to assess these complexities and dependencies regularly, making informed decisions on feature priorities and development focus. By maintaining flexibility in our planning, we can deliver a high-quality product that meets the needs of our users.

## Conclusion

We are committed to delivering a robust and user-friendly online course platform. Our agile methodology ensures that we can adapt to changes and continuously improve the project. Stay tuned for updates as we progress through our development sprints.
